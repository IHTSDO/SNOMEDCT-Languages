## SNOMED CT Computable Languages

This repository contains the formal syntax, example parsers, and valid example files for each computable language in the SNOMED CT Family of Languages.

The SNOMED CT Family of Languages currently includes:
* **SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar** - used to represent SNOMED CT expressions. The SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar Specification and Guide is available at [snomed.org/scg](http://snomed.org/scg)
* **SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Language** - used to represent SNOMED CT expression constraints and simple queries. The SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Language Specification and Guide is available at [snomed.org/ecl](http://snomed.org/ecl)
* **SNOMED CT Expression Template Language** - allows slots to be added to expressions, that can be filled with specific values at a later time. The SNOMED CT Expression Template Syntax combines SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar with the SNOMED CT Template Syntax. Please refer to [snomed.org/etl](http://snomed.org/etl) and [snomed.org/sts](http://snomed.org/sts)

It is anticipated that the following languages will be added to this repository in the future:

* **SNOMED CT Query Language** - used to represent computable queries over SNOMED CT content
* **SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Template Syntax** - allows slots to be added to expression constraints, that can be filled with specific values at a later time
* **SNOMED CT Query Template Syntax** â€“ allows slots to be added to SNOMED CT queries, that can be filled with specific values at a later time

The folders are organized as follows:
